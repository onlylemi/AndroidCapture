# AndroidCapture
This is a android app, it's a client for my **processing library** named **processing-android-capture**  

**android app豌豆荚下载地址：** (http://www.wandoujia.com/apps/com.onlylemi.android.capture)

**processing-android-capture:** [https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture](https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture)

This library tries to transfer data between [Processing](https://processing.org) and [Android](https://android.com). I make a android app to capture the real-time video from "Android camera"  through the socket to the server (processing server) with `WiFi`. The users use this lib to get phone camera capture in processing, then can do image processing. And currently support read the data of android sensor.

if there is a problem, please contact me or new a issues.
