# AndroidCapture
This is a android app, it's a client for my **processing library** named **processing-android-capture**

**processing-android-capture:** [https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture](https://github.com/onlylemi/processing-android-capture)

This library tries to transfer data between [Processing](https://processing.org) and [Android](https://android.com). I make a android app to capture the real-time video from ''Android camera''  through the socket to the server (processing server) with `WiFi`. The users use this lib to get phone camera capture in processing, then can do image processing. 

It's only beta named **''Beta1.0''**. Welcome to try it and if there is a problem, please contact me or new a issues. 

I will add most `Android sense` in **"Beta2.0"** and make it work in [openframeworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/).
